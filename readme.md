### ⚠️ I will not be properly maintaining this ⚠️
Feel free to fork it, clone it, or draw a picture of it on some stone tablets or something.

### What is this?
An extremely basic .net9.0 console app that checks the Nvidia stock API for 5080 and 5090 stock. It makes no attempts to purchase or
anything close to being a 'bot', it simply checks for stock and provides the link when there is some.

### How do I use this?
It's not really "fit for purpose", you'll need to know how to build a C# solution to use this.


### Why?
Mainly because I can. I did the same for the 30XX cards, I'm not even that particualrly interested in the 50XX cards. I just wanted to see if I *could* do it.
